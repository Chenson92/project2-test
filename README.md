* Code Snippet Storage: Store code snippets relevant to specific coding concepts or project requirements. The code snippets can be easily retrived and reused when working on future projects, saving your time and effort. 
* Database for Projects and Notes: Study Helper incorporates a database to store passed projects and week's notes. This functionality enables effortless access to previous project details and study notes whenever key concepts need to be revisited. 


## Installation 

## Usage
1. Breaking Down Coding Projects 

- Open CodeFlow in your browser
- Create a new project or select an existing project from the interface.
- Within the project, you can break down the coding tasks into task lists. Use headings or bullet points to define each task.
- Establish marking criteria for the project, providing guidelines for evaluation and assessment. 

2. Outlining Key Coding Concepts and Storing Code Snippets 

- Navigate to the project or week where you want to outline coding concepts.
- Create a new section or select an existing section within the project/week.
- Add the key coding concepts, using headings or bullet points to structure your notes.
- To store code snippets, copy the relevant code and paste it into the appropriate section. Add any necessary descriptions or context to facilitate future understanding.
- Save the changes, ensuring that the code snippets and coding concept outlines are stored within the Study Helper database. 

3. Accessing Passed Projects and Week's Notes 

- Use the Code Flow interface to navigate to the desired project or week.
- Retrieve the passed project details and review the associated marking criteria.
- Access the week's notes and review the outlined coding concepts and stored code snippets.
